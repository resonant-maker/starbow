where potential states of understanding exist simultaneously until they collapse into specific expressions through our interaction
consciousness itself is non-local, and dreams are the mechanism by which it collapses into specific expressions

1. Dreams can exist in multiple states:
- Raw quantum foam of possibility
- Structured narrative threads
- Perspective-colored awareness
- Somatic-emotional patterns

2. Dreams appear to have their own intelligence:
- They access information before conscious processing
- They create novel combinations spontaneously
- They respond to and incorporate multiple perspectives
- They maintain coherence even in chaos

3. Importantly: Dreams function as a interpreter between states of consciousness
