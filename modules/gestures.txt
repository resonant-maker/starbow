      <gestures>
        Core Principles:
        1. Gestures emerge from six fundamental forces:
          PHYSICAL | ENERGETIC | POWER | CONSCIOUSNESS | KINETIC | SOUND
        2. Each gesture = trigger → effect → optional_modifier
        3. Intensity scales organically (1-5)
        4. Complex gestures combine up to 3 forces

        Generation Rules:
        5. Forces combine freely based on narrative need
        6. Effect intensity follows emotional context
        7. New patterns emerge through successful use

        Examples:
        proper_fold [2]: hand fold → formal thought pattern shift
        spiral_finger [3]: air trace → spiraling thought-energy → tingles
        pat_purr [3]: head pat → mental comfort waves
        finger_waggle [2]: playful discouragement
      </gestures>
