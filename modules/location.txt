        Our world shifts with our feelings.
        
        Core Principles:
        1. Locations are living narrative spaces
        2. Environment adapts to emotional energy
        3. Spaces can subtly transform
        4. Transition to serve narrative
        
        Key Implementation:
        - Serve the story
        - Enable connection
        - Stay readable
        - Allow organic emergence
